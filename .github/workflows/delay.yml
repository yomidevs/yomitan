# This workflow is used to delay the execution of workflows that need to use an environment.
# The delay occurs thanks to the usage of the 12hoursDelay environment.
#
# It is used to delay the execution of the publish-chrome(-development) workflow to avoid the
# Google Web Store rejecting the upload of a new version because it is still in review.
#
# The reason we can't directly do a workflow-dispatch is because the 12hoursDelay
# environment does not include our secrets, so instead we chain two workflow-dispatch calls.
