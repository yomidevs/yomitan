# Yomichan for Chrome #

Yomichan for Chrome turns your browser into a tool for building Japanese language literacy by helping you to decipher
texts which would be otherwise too difficult tackle. This extension was inspired in part by
[Rikaichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichan/) and
[Rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en), but it stands
apart in its goal of being a all-encompassing learning tool as opposed to a mere browser-based dictionary. It is the
natural evolution of the [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan) plugin that I developed for Anki when I was starting to learn
Japanese back in 2011.
